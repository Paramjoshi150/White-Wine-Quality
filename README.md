# White-Wine-Quality

In this project, we aim to predict the quality of white wine by utilizing **Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques**. The dataset employed contains 4898 entries, each representing a sample of white wine characterized by 11 chemical properties: **fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol content**. The twelth attribute, quality, serves as the target variable, ranging from 3 to 9. Our objective is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify wine quality based on these chemical attributes. Initially, the quality classification faced challenges due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset. To enhance the model's performance, we transformed the quality ratings into a binary classification problem, categorizing wine quality into two classes: low (quality 3, 4, 5) and high (quality 6, 7, 8, 9). This adjustment allowed for improved model accuracy and reliability in predicting the quality of white wine. The process involved data standardization, train-test splitting, model training using SVM, and evaluation of the model's performance through confusion matrix and classification reports.
